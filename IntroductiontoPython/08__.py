# Program Specifications For practice with incremental development, write a program to output three statements as specified.

# Step 1 (4 pts). Use print() to output "Step 1 complete".
# Output should be:

# Step 1 complete

# Step 2 (3 pts). Use print() to output "Step 2 as well".

# Output should be:

# Step 1 complete
# Step 2 as well

# Step 3 (3 pts). Use print() to output "All steps now complete".
# Output should be:

# Step 1 complete
# Step 2 as well
# All steps now complete# Step prints for incremental development practice


print("Step 1 complete")
print("Step 2 as well")
print("All steps now complete")
