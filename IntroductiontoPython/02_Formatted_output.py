# Write a program that prints a formatted "No parking" sign as shown below. 
# Note the first line has two leading spaces. For ALL labs, end with newline
#  (unless otherwise stated).

# NO PARKING
# 2:00 - 6:00 a.m.

print("  NO PARKING")
print("2:00 - 6:00 a.m.")


# This exercise helps students focus on producing the exact output required,
#  which is a common requirement in programming assignments and coding challenges.
