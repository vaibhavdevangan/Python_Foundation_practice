# Given the user inputs, complete a program that does the following tasks:

# Define a set, fruits, containing the user inputs: my_fruit1, my_fruit2, and my_fruit3.
# Add the user inputs, your_fruit1 and your_fruit2, to fruits.
# Add the user input, their_fruit, to fruits.
# Add your_fruit1 to fruits.
# Remove my_fruit1 from fruits.
# Observe the output of each print statement carefully 
# to understand what was done by each task of the program.

# Note: For testing purposes, sets are printed using sorted() for comparison, 
# as in the book's examples.

# Ex: If the input is:

# apple
# peach
# lemon
# apple
# pear
# plum

# the output is:

# ['apple', 'lemon', 'peach']
# ['apple', 'lemon', 'peach', 'pear']
# ['apple', 'lemon', 'peach', 'pear', 'plum']
# ['apple', 'lemon', 'peach', 'pear', 'plum']
# ['lemon', 'peach', 'pear', 'plum']
